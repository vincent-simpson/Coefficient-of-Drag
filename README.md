## Background
This is an Android application developed in Android Studio designed to output the coefficient of drag for a vehicle based on a series of results. The results gathered from this application are the speed that the vehicle is currently going, and the time in seconds that it takes for the vehicle to decelerate in 10 mph increments. More about the way this application works below.

This application is not yet available for download on the Google Play Store and is currently still in testing.
